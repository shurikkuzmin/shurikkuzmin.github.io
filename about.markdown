My name is Alex Kuzmin.

Currently Iâ€™m working as a Turbomachinery Team Lead at Maya Heat Transfer Technologies located in Montreal. I help largest gas-turbine and aircraft manufacturers to simulate their beautiful machinery. We create one of the world best thermal solvers, and it's a pleasure for me to be a part of this. Previously I was a PostDoctoral fellow at the University of Alberta working on the [Lattice Boltzmann Method]({% link research.markdown %}) (wrote a book and a few papers). As well I was doing some consulting projects, mainly simulations of liquid-liquid-solid systems for Fortune 500 companies. 

I consider myself as a numerical methods specialist with a vast variety of tools in algorithms, visualization to simulate engineering and physics phenomena. I design, consult, plan and execute the development of scientific software. Through years I was involved in all possible aspects of development and design, including linear solvers, parallelization, performance improvements, etc
